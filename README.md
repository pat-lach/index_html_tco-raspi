This code is functional but needs to be optimized and simplified.
It allows you to display an HTML page on different PCs, tablets, telephones, and to control turnouts by clicking on the image of each turnout.
Theturnouts are controlled with an ESP8266 via an exchange of MQTT messages via Web socket
An action on a web page (representing the “TCO” optical control panel of the entire network) transmits the necessary messages to synchronize all the others web page
